In this assignment, we are recreating jail incarceration trends across different levels of urbanicity, originally published by Timothy Ittner https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/23780231241255582.

Using the replication package provided I: 1) recreated the original figure, 2) created a black and white version of the figure, 3) observed 2018 incarceration trends, 4) created a distorted version of the figure with a bogus headline to go along with it, and 5) created an interactive plot, focusing on one aspect of the original figure.

This repo includes the code to create all of the above, using Ittner's original code posted here: https://github.com/timittner/jail_trends. This file is named "Ittner_Casas_analysis.R." It also includes the data used in the analysis (original data comes from https://github.com/vera-institute/incarceration-trends). This data file can be found under "incarceration_trends.xlsx". It also includes the interactive plot as an html file, titled "interactive_ittner.html."
